# Sort

ok, one of the most fancy part about algorithm

1. stable

   origin sequence: `(a,90),(B,80),(c,90)`, sorted by number.

   stable sort: `(b,80),(a,90),(c,90)`, the relative position is not changed in `(a,90)` and `(c,90)`

   unstable sort: `(b,80),(c,90),(a,90)`, the relative position is has changed in `(a,90)` and `(c,90)`

2. sorted pass

   just convient our time complexity analyze

3. time complexity & space complexity

# simple sort

each loop select the smallest element in list and swap

```c

```
